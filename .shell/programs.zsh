mangadex () {
  # mangadex-downloader supports configuration via a file, but I personally don't like it, since it's written to on each
  # execution and resolves paths. In other words, it's more so machine configuration than user configuration.
  #
  # Note the exclusion of the --no-group-name option. This option removes group names from folders, leaving us with just
  # the volume and chapter number (e.g. "Vol. 12 Ch. 65"). While the option is ideal, for Mangadex, it's not appropriate
  # to use since N groups may have uploaded for a mangaâ€”including for the same chapter. mangadex-downloader does not
  # provide an option for resolving this conflict (it seems to just pick the oldest of the set), making it not ideal if
  # a certain uploader's work is superior. Unfortunately, this requires manual labor, so I'll have to manually find the
  # chapter in question and download the correct one.
