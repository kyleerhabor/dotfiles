# Download videos (mostly from YouTube).

# The command downloads videos with English subtitles and chapters, writing the filename in
# the format "<channel> - <title> [<video id>].<filetype>".
#
# The download preferences are set to prefer AVC video (H.264, but HEVC / H.265 is an option)
# and AAC audio. While YouTube offers several codecs (AV1, AVC, VP9; AAC, Opus), not all can
# be played correctly or efficiently on my device (2019 MacBook Pro). In particular, AV1 and
# VP9 achieve small filesizes at the cost of incinerating my CPU. The current configuration
# results in most videos looking fine, but can still cause issues (in particular, for real-life
# recordings like Not Just Bikes and China Street View).
#
# Some notes:
# - If a video with a playlist query parameter is given, only the video will be downloaded.
# - SponsorBlock segments are reflected as chapters.
#
# TODO: Disable default subtitles.
